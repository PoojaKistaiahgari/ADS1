Which of the following scenarios leads to expected linear running time for a random search hit in a linear-probing hash table?
a. All keys hash to the same index.
b. All keys hash to different indices.
c. All keys hash to an even-numbered index.
d. All keys hash to different even-numbered indices. 

Answer: (a) all keys hash to the same index.

Suppose that the keys A through G , with the hash values given below, are inserted in some order into an initially empty table of size 7 using a linear-probing table (with no resizing for this problem). Which of the following could not possibly result from inserting these keys?

A-not possible
B-not possible
c-not possible
d-possible
e-not possible
f-not possible
