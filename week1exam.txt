Instructions:
1.	If the output has multiple values/ multiple new line values write it as comma space separated.
2.	use the following Notations for writing Complexity Answers: N, 1, log(N), N^2, N*log(N), 2^N, N^3, log(N)


1. What does the following code fragment print when N is 50 ?
 Answer: N
2.Give the output printed by Queue for the input at the end of all operations
If “-” perform dequeue else enqueue each word.

Answer:
Step1 :Enqueue
Playing

Step2:enqueue
cricket	playing

Step3:dequeue -playing
cricket

is	cricket
Step4:enqueue

Step5: dequeue – cricket
is

Step6: enqueue
a	is

Step7: enqueue
hobby	a	is

Step8: dequeue - is
hobby	a

Step9:dequeue -a
hobby

Step10:enqueue
of	hobby

Step 11:dequeue-hobby
of

Step12:dequeu-of
Step13:enqueue
mentor

Step14:dequeue-mentor
Step15:enqueu
deepak
Step16:dequeue –deepak
Finally queue is empty

3.	Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations. The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?
Note: For answer write the options in order separated with comma and space eg: a, b, d 
a. 5 4 3 1 2 0 9 8 7 6
b. 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
c. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
d. 1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 0
e. 1 5 0 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
Answer: a,d,e

4. Give the minimum and maximum occupancy percentages for resizing arrays?
Give the number of components remain at the end of Quick Find Algorithm for the following union operations.
a. 3-4
b. 4-9
c. 8-0
d. 2-3
e. 5-6
f. 5-9
g. 7-3
h. 4-8
i. 6-1
Answer:                    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
max size:10
min size:1
			
5.{[]()} If you use stacks for checking parentheses balanced or not ? After each iteration, Print the size of the stack.
Answer: yes, it is balanced parentheses.
Step1:push {
Size of stack: top=0
Step2:push [
Size of stack: top=1
Step3 :pop
Size of stack : top=0
Step4:push
Size of stack top=1
Step5:pop
Size of stack top=0
Step 6: pop
Size of stack top=-1

Answer: 2 logN
 
7. Give the order of growth (as a function of n ) of the running times of the following code fragment:
Answer: N
 
8. Give the order of growth (as a function of n ) of the running times of the following code fragment:
Answer: N

9. Give the order of growth (as a function of n ) of the running times of the following code fragment:
Answer: N^2

10. Give the number of components remain at the end of Quick Find Algorithm for the following union operations.
a. 3-4
b. 4-9
c. 8-0
d. 2-3
e. 5-6
f. 5-9
g. 7-3
h. 4-8
i. 6-1
Answer:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

•	Download the zip file to find the question and testcases; the directory structure is similar to the sample-assignment seen in the previous activity
•	Add a subfolder m6 for Module 6
•	Unzip the starter code into m6 folder. You should see a folder with the name Assignment-1
•	You should write your solution in the file Solution.java
•	There are a few lines of code to handle the input testcases
•	After you write the code use eval to check if you got all the testcases right
•	submit commit ID in the textbox below.
